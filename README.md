# Custom_website_chatbot
This project is a custom chatbot designed to help students easily access accurate, up-to-date information about some selected Nigerian universities and the latest updates in the admission process. By scraping and processing official university websites, the chatbot provides users with a reliable source of information that can assist them in making informed decisions regarding their academic pursuits.

Project Overview
This chatbot is built using the Langchain library for natural language processing, FAISS for efficient similarity search, and OpenAI's GPT model to answer queries. It uses Streamlit as the frontend framework to provide an easy-to-use interface for students. The chatbot retrieves data from specific Nigerian university websites, parses it, and responds to user queries by providing relevant answers along with source links.
